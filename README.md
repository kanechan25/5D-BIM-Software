# BIM5D Application
- <strong>BIM5D is a project which is the application to support Civil Engineer in quantity construction calculation and cost estimation. </strong>
- Simply understanding, in the AEC (Architectural Engineering and Construction) industry, I have a building, I have to know quantities of everything (concrete, tiles, ceiling, rebar, brick ... etc)
Then, I calculate the cost estimate of that building.

- It's written by Revit API, C# (OOP, winforms), SQL, VBScript.
<h4>The application includes 3 main part: </h4>
<strong>
	<ul>
	<li>1. bim5d software: Core, this part calculates all elements of the building, contains algorithm, rules, calculation</li>
	<li>2. bim5d add-in: Add-in attaches to Autodesk Software, supports throughout the building modeling process</li>
	<li>3. bim5d database management: arranges, backup, saves all components database of BIM technologist</li>
	</ul>
</strong>

## And software operates as below:
- After using add-in <strong>bim5d add-in</strong>, I export information of building to .json, .csv, .xlsx... files

The next, I use them as meterials to go to <strong>bim5d software</strong>:
- The first, when I run the software, the initial form appears. Here, click [Import Files] button to add files:

- The results of TIO software that exported to Excel files are supported to format, calculate or get important information for preparing for the next steps:

- The third stage, I will deal with rebar files. This form helps you calculate accurately the length of rebars, such as rebar hook, rebar bending, or rebar lap splices...
	Then results will are save and sync to Cloud.

- Finally, the most important, I calculate, take-off quantity, sum up and fill them to file BOQ (Bill of Quantity).
Rebars (structure department) also are added together on all final quantity BOQ.
	Quantities that are classified by categories or leveled by height make Quantity Surveyor easier about quantity management:

- Hoping it support you a bit in your work!
